/**
 * Redeem Fee Verifier
 *
 * `redeemAndShield` (issue #312) does NOT pay the relayer via a broadcaster output inside the SNARK
 * proof — that's `broadcaster-fee-verifier.ts`'s job for `lendAndShield` / `atomicCrossChainUnshield`.
 * Instead the adapter shields `_feeAmount` USDC out of the redeemed proceeds to the relayer's own 0zk
 * note (`_feeNpk` / `_feeShieldCiphertext`), with all three bound into the proof's `adaptParams`.
 *
 * The proof binding stops a *submitter* from altering the fee after proof-gen, but it does NOT prove
 * the fee is directed at US: a malicious submitter can build a valid proof whose fee note is their
 * OWN address, and the relayer would pay gas for a fee it never receives. So the relayer must
 * independently confirm the fee note is addressed to itself.
 *
 * How:
 *   A shield note's public key is a deterministic commitment `npk = Poseidon(masterPublicKey, random)`
 *   (`ShieldNote.getNotePublicKey`). The masterPublicKey is public (it's in a 0zk address); the
 *   per-note `random` is the secret blinding factor. The frontend generated this fee note to the
 *   relayer's address and passes the `random` alongside the /relay request (the relayer is the note's
 *   recipient — it would decrypt this same `random` during normal balance sync, so nothing new leaks).
 *   We recompute `Poseidon(ourMasterPublicKey, random)` (via the injected `deriver`) and require it to
 *   equal the on-chain `_feeNpk`. Forging a `random` to hit a target npk under a *different* master key
 *   is preimage-hard, so a match proves the fee note is ours. We also require `_feeAmount >= advertisedFee`.
 *
 *   Token is not checked here: the adapter shields the fee from the redeemed USDC proceeds, so the fee
 *   note is always USDC by construction (the submitter cannot substitute a worthless token).
